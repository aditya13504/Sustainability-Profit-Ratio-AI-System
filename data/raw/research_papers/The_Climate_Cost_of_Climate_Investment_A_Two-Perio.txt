TITLE: The Climate Cost of Climate Investment: A Two-Period Perspective

ABSTRACT:
A one-size-fits-all paradigm that only adapts the scale and immediate outcome
of climate investment to economic circumstances will provide a short-lived,
economically inadequate response to climate issues; given the limited resources
allocated to green finance, it stands to reason that the shortcomings of this
will be exacerbated by the fact that it comes at the cost of long-term,
self-perpetuating, systemic solutions. Financial commitments that do not
consider the capital structure of green finance in an economy will cumulatively
dis-aggregate the economic cost of climate investment, to erode the competitive
advantage of the most innovative economies, while simultaneously imposing the
greatest financial burden on economies that are most vulnerable to the impact
of climate change; such disaggregation will also leave 'middle' economies in a
state of flux - honouring similar financial commitments to vulnerable or highly
developed peers, but unable to generate comparable return, yet sufficiently
insulated from the impact of extreme climate phenomena to not organically
develop solutions.
  In the face of these changing realities, green innovation needs to expand
beyond technology and address systemic inefficiencies - lack of clear
responsibility, ambiguously defined commitments, and inadequate checks &
balances to name a few.
  Clever application of financial engineering demonstrates promise, and simple
measures like carbon-credit exchanges have been effective in mitigating
imperfections at the grassroots level. We believe that information- and
incentive-centric systemic advancements can usher a fresh wave of green
innovation that stands on the shoulders of giants to ensure effective
implementation of technological breakthroughs; economic development that will
create an international community equipped with a robust framework to deal with
long-term crises in a strategic manner.
