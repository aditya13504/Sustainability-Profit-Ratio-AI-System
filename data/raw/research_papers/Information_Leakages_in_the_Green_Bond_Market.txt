ABSTRACT:
Public announcement dates are used in the green bond literature to measure
equity market reactions to upcoming green bond issues. We find a sizeable
number of green bond announcements were pre-dated by anonymous information
leakages on the Bloomberg Terminal. From a candidate set of 2,036 'Bloomberg
News' and 'Bloomberg First Word' headlines gathered between 2016 and 2022, we
identify 259 instances of green bond-related information being released before
being publicly announced by the issuing firm. These pre-announcement leaks
significantly alter the equity trading dynamics of the issuing firms over
intraday and daily event windows. Significant negative abnormal returns and
increased trading volumes are observed following news leaks about upcoming
green bond issues. These negative investor reactions are concentrated amongst
financial firms, and leaks that arrive pre-market or early in market trading.
We find equity price movements following news leaks can be explained to a
greater degree than following public announcements. Sectoral differences are
also observed in the key drivers behind investor reactions to green bond leaks
by non-financials (Tobin's Q and free cash flow) and financials (ROA). Our
results suggest that information leakages have a strong impact on market
behaviour, and should be accounted for in green bond literature. Our findings
also have broader ramifications for financial literature going forward.
Privileged access to financially material information, courtesy of the
ubiquitous use of Bloomberg Terminals by professional investors, highlights the
need for event studies to consider wider sets of communication channels to
confirm the date at which information first becomes available.
