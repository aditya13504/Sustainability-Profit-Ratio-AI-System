ABSTRACT:
Sustainable Investing identifies the approach of investors whose aim is
twofold: on the one hand, they want to achieve the best compromise between
portfolio risk and return, but they also want to take into account the
sustainability of their investment, assessed through some Environmental,
Social, and Governance (ESG) criteria. The inclusion of sustainable goals in
the portfolio selection process may have an actual impact on financial
portfolio performance. ESG indices provided by the rating agencies are
generally considered good proxies for the performance in sustainability of an
investment, as well as, appropriate measures for Socially Responsible
Investments (SRI) in the market. In this framework of analysis, the lack of
alignment between ratings provided by different agencies is a crucial issue
that inevitably undermines the robustness and reliability of these evaluation
measures. In fact, the ESG rating disagreement may produce conflicting
information, implying a difficulty for the investor in the portfolio ESG
evaluation. This may cause underestimation or overestimation of the market
opportunities for a sustainable investment. In this paper, we deal with a
multi-criteria portfolio selection problem taking into account risk, return,
and ESG criteria. For the ESG evaluation of the securities in the market, we
consider more than one agency and propose a new approach to overcome the
problem related to the disagreement between the ESG ratings by different
agencies. We propose a nonlinear optimization model for our three-criteria
portfolio selection problem. We show that it can be reformulated as an
equivalent convex quadratic program by exploiting a technique known in the
literature as the k-sum optimization strategy. An extensive empirical analysis
of the performance of this model is provided on real-world financial data sets.
