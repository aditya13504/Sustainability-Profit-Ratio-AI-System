The China Trade Shock and the ESG Performances of US firms,"Hui Xu, Yue Wu",2022-01-28,"How does import competition from China affect engagement on ESG initiatives
by US corporates? On the one hand, reduced profitability due to import
competition and lagging ESG performance of Chinese exporters can disincentivize
US firms to put more resources to ESG initiatives. On the other hand, the shift
from labor-intensive production to capital/technology-intensive production
along with offshoring may improve the US company's ESG performance. Moreover,
US companies have incentives to actively pursue more ESG engagement to
differentiate from Chinese imports. Exploiting a trade policy in which US
congress granted China the Permanent Normal Trade Relations and the resulting
change in expected tariff rates on Chinese imports, we find that greater import
competition from China leads to an increase in the US company's ESG
performance. The improvement primarily stems from ""doing more positives"" and
from more involvement on environmental initiatives. Indirect and direct
evidence shows that the improvement is not driven by the change in production
process or offshoring, but is consistent with product differentiation. Our
results suggest that the trade shock from China has significant impact on the
US company's ESG performance.","q-fin.GN, econ.GN, q-fin.EC",http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.12402v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.12402v1,ESG corporate profitability,0.0
InvestESG: A multi-agent reinforcement learning benchmark for studying climate investment as a social dilemma,"Xiaoxuan Hou, Jiayi Yuan, Joel Z. Leibo, Natasha Jaques",2024-11-15,"InvestESG is a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) benchmark
designed to study the impact of Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG)
disclosure mandates on corporate climate investments. The benchmark models an
intertemporal social dilemma where companies balance short-term profit losses
from climate mitigation efforts and long-term benefits from reducing climate
risk, while ESG-conscious investors attempt to influence corporate behavior
through their investment decisions. Companies allocate capital across
mitigation, greenwashing, and resilience, with varying strategies influencing
climate outcomes and investor preferences. We are releasing open-source
versions of InvestESG in both PyTorch and JAX, which enable scalable and
hardware-accelerated simulations for investigating competing incentives in
mitigate climate change. Our experiments show that without ESG-conscious
investors with sufficient capital, corporate mitigation efforts remain limited
under the disclosure mandate. However, when a critical mass of investors
prioritizes ESG, corporate cooperation increases, which in turn reduces climate
risks and enhances long-term financial stability. Additionally, providing more
information about global climate risks encourages companies to invest more in
mitigation, even without investor involvement. Our findings align with
empirical research using real-world data, highlighting MARL's potential to
inform policy by providing insights into large-scale socio-economic challenges
through efficient testing of alternative policy and market designs.","cs.LG, cs.CY, cs.MA, econ.GN, q-fin.EC",http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09856v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.09856v3,ESG corporate profitability,0.0
ESG In Corporate Filings: An AI Perspective,"Irene Aldridge, Payton Martin",2022-11-30,"Our main contribution is that we are using AI to discern the key drivers of
variation of ESG mentions in the corporate filings. With AI, we are able to
separate ""dimensions"" along which the corporate management presents their ESG
policies to the world. These dimensions are 1) diversity, 2) hazardous
materials, and 3) greenhouse gasses. We are also able to identify separate
""background"" dimensions of unofficial ESG activity in the firms, which provide
more color into the firms and their shareholders' thinking about their ESG
processes. We then measure investors' response to the ESG activity ""factors"".
The AI techniques presented can assist in building better, more reliable and
useful ESG ratings systems.","econ.GN, q-fin.EC, q-fin.GN",http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.00018v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.00018v1,ESG corporate profitability,0.0
Study on the impact of trade policy uncertainty on the performance of enterprise ESG performance,"Hanqin Chen, Ye Lu, Huaqin Huang",2025-01-17,"Trade policy uncertainty has become a significant feature of today's global
economy. While its impact on free trade is evident, its microeconomic effects
remain open to debate. This study explores the influence of trade policy
uncertainty on corporate ESG performance and its underlying mechanisms, using
data from A-share listed companies in China from 2010 to 2020. The findings
reveal that increased trade policy uncertainty significantly and robustly
enhances corporate ESG performance. Heterogeneity analysis indicates that
high-tech enterprises are better equipped to improve their ESG performance in
response to trade policy uncertainty. Furthermore, strengthening internal
controls and appointing CEOs with environmental backgrounds also help firms
seize the opportunities arising from trade policy uncertainty. In terms of
mechanisms, trade policy uncertainty intensifies industry competition,
compelling firms to enhance their ESG performance to gain market share.
Additionally, it stimulates green technological innovation, further optimizing
ESG outcomes. Therefore, efforts should focus on improving the ESG standards
system, establishing ESG incentive policies, increasing the transparency and
predictability of trade policies, and promoting corporate green development to
advance national sustainable development goals.","econ.GN, q-fin.EC",http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01640v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.01640v1,ESG corporate profitability,0.0
Automatic ESG Assessment of Companies by Mining and Evaluating Media Coverage Data: NLP Approach and Tool,"Jannik Fischbach, Max Adam, Victor Dzhagatspanyan, Daniel Mendez, Julian Frattini, Oleksandr Kosenkov, Parisa Elahidoost",2022-12-13,"Context: Sustainable corporate behavior is increasingly valued by society and
impacts corporate reputation and customer trust. Hence, companies regularly
publish sustainability reports to shed light on their impact on environmental,
social, and governance (ESG) factors. Problem: Sustainability reports are
written by companies themselves and are therefore considered a
company-controlled source. Contrary, studies reveal that non-corporate channels
(e.g., media coverage) represent the main driver for ESG transparency. However,
analysing media coverage regarding ESG factors is challenging since (1) the
amount of published news articles grows daily, (2) media coverage data does not
necessarily deal with an ESG-relevant topic, meaning that it must be carefully
filtered, and (3) the majority of media coverage data is unstructured. Research
Goal: We aim to extract ESG-relevant information from textual media reactions
automatically to calculate an ESG score for a given company. Our goal is to
reduce the cost of ESG data collection and make ESG information available to
the general public. Contribution: Our contributions are three-fold: First, we
publish a corpus of 432,411 news headlines annotated as being environmental-,
governance-, social-related, or ESG-irrelevant. Second, we present our
tool-supported approach called ESG-Miner capable of analyzing and evaluating
headlines on corporate ESG-performance automatically. Third, we demonstrate the
feasibility of our approach in an experiment and apply the ESG-Miner on 3000
manually labeled headlines. Our approach processes 96.7 % of the headlines
correctly and shows a great performance in detecting environmental-related
headlines along with their correct sentiment. We encourage fellow researchers
and practitioners to use the ESG-Miner at https://www.esg-miner.com.",cs.IR,http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.06540v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.06540v2,ESG corporate profitability,0.0
What Does ChatGPT Make of Historical Stock Returns? Extrapolation and Miscalibration in LLM Stock Return Forecasts,"Shuaiyu Chen, T. Clifton Green, Huseyin Gulen, Dexin Zhou",2024-09-17,"We examine how large language models (LLMs) interpret historical stock
returns and compare their forecasts with estimates from a crowd-sourced
platform for ranking stocks. While stock returns exhibit short-term reversals,
LLM forecasts over-extrapolate, placing excessive weight on recent performance
similar to humans. LLM forecasts appear optimistic relative to historical and
future realized returns. When prompted for 80% confidence interval predictions,
LLM responses are better calibrated than survey evidence but are pessimistic
about outliers, leading to skewed forecast distributions. The findings suggest
LLMs manifest common behavioral biases when forecasting expected returns but
are better at gauging risks than humans.","q-fin.GN, econ.GN, q-fin.EC",http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11540v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.11540v1,green finance returns,0.0
Robust blue-green urban flood risk management optimised with a genetic algorithm for multiple rainstorm return periods,"Asid Ur Rehman, Vassilis Glenis, Elizabeth Lewis, Chris Kilsby, Claire Walsh",2025-02-13,"Flood risk managers seek to optimise Blue-Green Infrastructure (BGI) designs
to maximise return on investment. Current systems often use optimisation
algorithms and detailed flood models to maximise benefit-cost ratios for single
rainstorm return periods. However, these schemes may lack robustness in
mitigating flood risks across different storm magnitudes. For example, a BGI
scheme optimised for a 100-year return period may differ from one optimised for
a 10-year return period. This study introduces a novel methodology
incorporating five return periods (T = 10, 20, 30, 50, and 100 years) into a
multi-objective BGI optimisation framework. The framework combines a
Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II) with a fully distributed
hydrodynamic model to optimise the spatial placement and combined size of BGI
features. For the first time, direct damage cost (DDC) and expected annual
damage (EAD), calculated for various building types, are used as risk objective
functions, transforming a many-objective problem into a multi-objective one.
Performance metrics such as Median Risk Difference (MedRD), Maximum Risk
Difference (MaxRD), and Area Under Pareto Front (AUPF) reveal that a 100-year
optimised BGI design performs poorly when evaluated for other return periods,
particularly shorter ones. In contrast, a BGI design optimised using composite
return periods enhances performance metrics across all return periods, with the
greatest improvements observed in MedRD (22%) and AUPF (73%) for the 20-year
return period, and MaxRD (23%) for the 50-year return period. Furthermore,
climate uplift stress testing confirms the robustness of the proposed design to
future rainfall extremes. This study advocates a paradigm shift in flood risk
management, moving from single maximum to multiple rainstorm return
period-based designs to enhance resilience and adaptability to future climate
extremes.","cs.NE, cs.CE, cs.CY",http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12174v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.12174v1,green finance returns,0.0
Information Leakages in the Green Bond Market,"Darren Shannon, Jin Gong, Barry Sheehan",2025-04-04,"Public announcement dates are used in the green bond literature to measure
equity market reactions to upcoming green bond issues. We find a sizeable
number of green bond announcements were pre-dated by anonymous information
leakages on the Bloomberg Terminal. From a candidate set of 2,036 'Bloomberg
News' and 'Bloomberg First Word' headlines gathered between 2016 and 2022, we
identify 259 instances of green bond-related information being released before
being publicly announced by the issuing firm. These pre-announcement leaks
significantly alter the equity trading dynamics of the issuing firms over
intraday and daily event windows. Significant negative abnormal returns and
increased trading volumes are observed following news leaks about upcoming
green bond issues. These negative investor reactions are concentrated amongst
financial firms, and leaks that arrive pre-market or early in market trading.
We find equity price movements following news leaks can be explained to a
greater degree than following public announcements. Sectoral differences are
also observed in the key drivers behind investor reactions to green bond leaks
by non-financials (Tobin's Q and free cash flow) and financials (ROA). Our
results suggest that information leakages have a strong impact on market
behaviour, and should be accounted for in green bond literature. Our findings
also have broader ramifications for financial literature going forward.
Privileged access to financially material information, courtesy of the
ubiquitous use of Bloomberg Terminals by professional investors, highlights the
need for event studies to consider wider sets of communication channels to
confirm the date at which information first becomes available.","q-fin.PR, q-fin.GN, q-fin.TR",http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03311v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.03311v1,green finance returns,0.0
Heterogeneity and Increasing Returns May Drive Socio-Economic Transitions,"Gérard Weisbuch, Vincent Buskens, Luat Vuong",2007-06-11,"There are clear benefits associated with a particular consumer choice for
many current markets. For example, as we consider here, some products might
carry environmental or `green' benefits. Some consumers might value these
benefits while others do not. However, as evidenced by myriad failed attempts
of environmental products to maintain even a niche market, such benefits do not
necessarily outweigh the extra purchasing cost. The question we pose is, how
can such an initially economically-disadvantaged green product evolve to hold
the greater share of the market? We present a simple mathematical model for the
dynamics of product competition in a heterogeneous consumer population. Our
model preassigns a hierarchy to the products, which designates the consumer
choice when prices are comparable, while prices are dynamically rescaled to
reflect increasing returns to scale. Our approach allows us to model many
scenarios of technology substitution and provides a method for generalizing
market forces. With this model, we begin to forecast irreversible trends
associated with consumer dynamics as well as policies that could be made to
influence transitions","q-fin.GN, physics.soc-ph",http://arxiv.org/abs/0706.1454v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/0706.1454v1,green finance returns,0.0
The Climate Cost of Climate Investment: A Two-Period Perspective,"Shaunak Kulkarni, Rohan Ajay Dubey",2024-08-26,"A one-size-fits-all paradigm that only adapts the scale and immediate outcome
of climate investment to economic circumstances will provide a short-lived,
economically inadequate response to climate issues; given the limited resources
allocated to green finance, it stands to reason that the shortcomings of this
will be exacerbated by the fact that it comes at the cost of long-term,
self-perpetuating, systemic solutions. Financial commitments that do not
consider the capital structure of green finance in an economy will cumulatively
dis-aggregate the economic cost of climate investment, to erode the competitive
advantage of the most innovative economies, while simultaneously imposing the
greatest financial burden on economies that are most vulnerable to the impact
of climate change; such disaggregation will also leave 'middle' economies in a
state of flux - honouring similar financial commitments to vulnerable or highly
developed peers, but unable to generate comparable return, yet sufficiently
insulated from the impact of extreme climate phenomena to not organically
develop solutions.
  In the face of these changing realities, green innovation needs to expand
beyond technology and address systemic inefficiencies - lack of clear
responsibility, ambiguously defined commitments, and inadequate checks &
balances to name a few.
  Clever application of financial engineering demonstrates promise, and simple
measures like carbon-credit exchanges have been effective in mitigating
imperfections at the grassroots level. We believe that information- and
incentive-centric systemic advancements can usher a fresh wave of green
innovation that stands on the shoulders of giants to ensure effective
implementation of technological breakthroughs; economic development that will
create an international community equipped with a robust framework to deal with
long-term crises in a strategic manner.","econ.GN, q-fin.EC",http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14359v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.14359v1,green finance returns,0.0
Managing ESG Ratings Disagreement in Sustainable Portfolio Selection,"Francesco Cesarone, Manuel Luis Martino, Federica Ricca, Andrea Scozzari",2023-12-17,"Sustainable Investing identifies the approach of investors whose aim is
twofold: on the one hand, they want to achieve the best compromise between
portfolio risk and return, but they also want to take into account the
sustainability of their investment, assessed through some Environmental,
Social, and Governance (ESG) criteria. The inclusion of sustainable goals in
the portfolio selection process may have an actual impact on financial
portfolio performance. ESG indices provided by the rating agencies are
generally considered good proxies for the performance in sustainability of an
investment, as well as, appropriate measures for Socially Responsible
Investments (SRI) in the market. In this framework of analysis, the lack of
alignment between ratings provided by different agencies is a crucial issue
that inevitably undermines the robustness and reliability of these evaluation
measures. In fact, the ESG rating disagreement may produce conflicting
information, implying a difficulty for the investor in the portfolio ESG
evaluation. This may cause underestimation or overestimation of the market
opportunities for a sustainable investment. In this paper, we deal with a
multi-criteria portfolio selection problem taking into account risk, return,
and ESG criteria. For the ESG evaluation of the securities in the market, we
consider more than one agency and propose a new approach to overcome the
problem related to the disagreement between the ESG ratings by different
agencies. We propose a nonlinear optimization model for our three-criteria
portfolio selection problem. We show that it can be reformulated as an
equivalent convex quadratic program by exploiting a technique known in the
literature as the k-sum optimization strategy. An extensive empirical analysis
of the performance of this model is provided on real-world financial data sets.","q-fin.PM, q-fin.CP, q-fin.RM",http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10739v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.10739v1,sustainable investing performance,0.0
Effects of syndication network on specialisation and performance of venture capital firms,"Qing Yao, Shaodong Ma, Jing Liang, Kim Christensen, Wanru Jing, Ruiqi Li",2022-11-02,"The Chinese venture capital (VC) market is a young and rapidly expanding
financial subsector. Gaining a deeper understanding of the investment
behaviours of VC firms is crucial for the development of a more sustainable and
healthier market and economy. Contrasting evidence supports that either
specialisation or diversification helps to achieve a better investment
performance. However, the impact of the syndication network is overlooked.
Syndication network has a great influence on the propagation of information and
trust. By exploiting an authoritative VC dataset of thirty-five-year investment
information in China, we construct a joint-investment network of VC firms and
analyse the effects of syndication and diversification on specialisation and
investment performance. There is a clear correlation between the syndication
network degree and specialisation level of VC firms, which implies that the
well-connected VC firms are diversified. More connections generally bring about
more information or other resources, and VC firms are more likely to enter a
new stage or industry with some new co-investing VC firms when compared to a
randomised null model. Moreover, autocorrelation analysis of both
specialisation and success rate on the syndication network indicates that
clustering of similar VC firms is roughly limited to the secondary
neighbourhood. When analysing local clustering patterns, we discover that,
contrary to popular beliefs, there is no apparent successful club of investors.
In contrast, investors with low success rates are more likely to cluster. Our
discoveries enrich the understanding of VC investment behaviours and can assist
policymakers in designing better strategies to promote the development of the
VC industry.","physics.soc-ph, econ.EM, stat.AP",http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.00873v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.00873v1,sustainable investing performance,0.0
Financial Markets and ESG: How Big Data is Transforming Sustainable Investing in Developing countries,"A T M Omor Faruq, Md Ataur Rahman Chowdhury",2025-03-09,"This study explores the role of big data adoption and financial market
development in driving ESG investments in developing countries, using an
instrumental variable (IV) approach to address endogeneity. The results show
that big data adoption significantly enhances ESG investing, as data-driven
analytics improve sustainability assessments and capital allocation. Financial
market development also positively influences ESG investments, but its effect
is relatively small. A key finding is that inflation negatively impacts ESG
investment, highlighting the importance of macroeconomic stability in fostering
sustainable finance. In contrast, GDP per capita and foreign direct investment
(FDI) are not significant determinants, suggesting that economic growth alone
does not drive sustainability efforts. Overall, this study provides empirical
evidence that leveraging big data and financial market improvements can
accelerate sustainable investing in emerging economies. Policymakers should
focus on technological advancements, financial reforms, and inflation control
to strengthen ESG investments and long-term sustainability commitments.","econ.GN, q-fin.EC",http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06696v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.06696v1,sustainable investing performance,0.0
Measuring Transition Risk in Investment Funds,Ricardo Crisostomo,2022-10-27,"We develop a comprehensive framework to measure the impact of the climate
transition on investment portfolios. Our analysis is enriched by including
geographical, sectoral, company and ISIN-level data to assess transition risk.
We find that investment funds suffer a moderate 5.7% loss upon materialization
of a high transition risk scenario. However, the risk distribution is
significantly left-skewed, with the worst 1% funds experiencing an average loss
of 21.3%. In terms of asset classes, equities are the worst performers
(-12.7%), followed by corporate bonds (-5.6%) and government bonds (-4.8%). We
discriminate among financial instruments by considering the carbon footprint of
specific counterparties and the credit rating, duration, convexity and
volatility of individual exposures. We find that sustainable funds are less
exposed to transition risk and perform better than the overall fund sector in
the low-carbon transition, validating their choice as green investments.","q-fin.RM, econ.GN, q-fin.EC, q-fin.PM",http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.15329v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.15329v3,sustainable investing performance,0.0
Crosswashing in Sustainable Investing: Unveiling Strategic Practices Impacting ESG Scores,"Bertrand Kian Hassani, Yacoub Bahini",2024-03-21,"This paper introduces and defines a novel concept in sustainable investing,
termed crosswashing, and explore its impact on ESG (Environmental, Social, and

Decision Making (MCDM) model. The study emphasises that this specific form of
greenwashing is not currently considered in existing ESG assessments,
potentially leading to an inflated perception of corporate ethical practices.
Unlike traditional greenwashing, crosswashing involves companies strategically
investing in sustainable activities to boost Environmental, Social, and

unveiling the nuances of crosswashing, the research contributes to a more
nuanced understanding of sustainable investing, offering insights for improved
