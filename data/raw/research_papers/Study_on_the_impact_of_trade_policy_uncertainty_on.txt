ABSTRACT:
Trade policy uncertainty has become a significant feature of today's global
economy. While its impact on free trade is evident, its microeconomic effects
remain open to debate. This study explores the influence of trade policy
uncertainty on corporate ESG performance and its underlying mechanisms, using
data from A-share listed companies in China from 2010 to 2020. The findings
reveal that increased trade policy uncertainty significantly and robustly
enhances corporate ESG performance. Heterogeneity analysis indicates that
high-tech enterprises are better equipped to improve their ESG performance in
response to trade policy uncertainty. Furthermore, strengthening internal
controls and appointing CEOs with environmental backgrounds also help firms
seize the opportunities arising from trade policy uncertainty. In terms of
mechanisms, trade policy uncertainty intensifies industry competition,
compelling firms to enhance their ESG performance to gain market share.
Additionally, it stimulates green technological innovation, further optimizing
ESG outcomes. Therefore, efforts should focus on improving the ESG standards
system, establishing ESG incentive policies, increasing the transparency and
predictability of trade policies, and promoting corporate green development to
advance national sustainable development goals.
