ABSTRACT:
This study explores the role of big data adoption and financial market
development in driving ESG investments in developing countries, using an
instrumental variable (IV) approach to address endogeneity. The results show
that big data adoption significantly enhances ESG investing, as data-driven
analytics improve sustainability assessments and capital allocation. Financial
market development also positively influences ESG investments, but its effect
is relatively small. A key finding is that inflation negatively impacts ESG
investment, highlighting the importance of macroeconomic stability in fostering
sustainable finance. In contrast, GDP per capita and foreign direct investment
(FDI) are not significant determinants, suggesting that economic growth alone
does not drive sustainability efforts. Overall, this study provides empirical
evidence that leveraging big data and financial market improvements can
accelerate sustainable investing in emerging economies. Policymakers should
focus on technological advancements, financial reforms, and inflation control
to strengthen ESG investments and long-term sustainability commitments.
